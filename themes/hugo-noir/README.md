## Content Structure üìÅ

The theme expects the following content structure:

```
content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md          # Homepage content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.md           # About page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ experience.md      # Experience page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects.md        # Projects page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blog.md            # Blogs Page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contact.md         # Contact page
```

Each page can use front matter to customize its appearance and behavior.

---

## Front Matter Examples üìù

### Blog Post

```yaml
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2023-03-15T10:30:00+05:30
draft: false
tags: ["hugo", "web development"]
categories: ["tutorials"]
description: "A detailed description of the post for SEO and previews"
featured_image: "/images/post-cover.jpg"

---
```

---
```

## Customization üé®

### Custom CSS

You can customize the theme by modifying the following files:

- `assets/css/custom.css`: Add your custom CSS styles here
- `assets/css/variables.css`: Modify theme variables like colors and fonts

## Custom Icons

You can add custom icons to your site by using SVG icons. SVGs are preferred because they're lightweight, scalable, and render crisply on all devices without losing quality.

You can find free SVG icons at these popular sites:
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) (great for brand/tech stack icons)
- [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/) (specifically for programming languages and tools)

I included it inline in the HTML for better performance and speed. 

Example of custom CSS:

```css
/* assets/css/custom.css */
.site-header {
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.post-title {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  color: var(--primary-color);
}
```


Example:

```javascript
// assets/js/custom.js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  console.log('Custom JavaScript loaded');
  
  // Your custom code here
});
```

### HTML Templates

For more advanced customization, you can override the theme's templates by creating your own versions in your site's `layouts` directory:

- `layouts/_default/single.html`: Override the default single page template
- `layouts/_default/list.html`: Override the default list template
- `layouts/partials/header.html`: Override the header partial
